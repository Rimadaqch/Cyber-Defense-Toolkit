#Model: Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest 
Overview
The Isolation Forest algorithm is employed in this project to identify anomalies in network traffic. It is particularly well-suited for anomaly detection due to its efficiency and effectiveness in isolating anomalies from normal data points.

Why Isolation Forest?
Isolation Forest is chosen for several reasons:

Efficiency:

Linear Time Complexity: Isolation Forest operates in linear time with a low memory requirement, making it scalable for large datasets.

Fast Execution: It quickly isolates anomalies by recursively generating partitions, making it efficient for real-time detection scenarios.

Effectiveness:

Isolation Principle: Instead of profiling normal data points, it isolates anomalies by their attribute values, leading to a clear distinction between normal and abnormal data.

Robust to Noise: The model is resilient to noisy data, which is common in network traffic, ensuring stable and reliable anomaly detection.

Versatility:

Unsupervised Learning: It does not require labeled data, which is beneficial in situations where labeling network traffic is difficult or infeasible.

Handles High Dimensionality: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, which is typical in cybersecurity datasets, without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.

Implementation Details
In the Cyber Defense Toolkit, the Isolation Forest model is implemented as follows:

Training: The model is trained on the Flow Bytes/s feature from the network traffic data. This feature captures the flow of bytes per second, a critical metric for identifying unusual traffic patterns.

Detection: After training, the model predicts anomalies within the network traffic data. Each data point is assigned an anomaly score, with high scores indicating potential anomalies.
