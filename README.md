### Threat Detection
**Purpose:** Identify potential malicious activities or security breaches within the network traffic.
**Method:** Analyzes key metrics such as packet lengths and flow statistics to detect suspicious activities.

### Anomaly Detection
**Purpose:** Discover unusual patterns in network traffic that deviate from normal behavior, signifying possible security incidents.
**Method:** Uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify and label anomalies in the data.

### Vulnerability Scanning
**Purpose:** Detect potential vulnerabilities in network assets that attackers could exploit.
**Method:** Simulates vulnerability scans to identify open ports, outdated software, or misconfigurations.

## Model: Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest

### Overview
The Isolation Forest algorithm is employed for anomaly detection, effectively identifying unusual patterns in network traffic.

### Why Isolation Forest?

#### Efficiency
- **Linear Time Complexity:** Operates in linear time with low memory requirements.
- **Fast Execution:** Quickly isolates anomalies by recursively generating partitions.

#### Effectiveness
- **Isolation Principle:** Isolates anomalies by their attribute values, leading to a clear distinction between normal and abnormal data.
- **Robust to Noise:** Resilient to noisy data, ensuring reliable anomaly detection.

#### Versatility
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Does not require labeled data.
- **Handles High Dimensionality:** Effective in high-dimensional spaces without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.
