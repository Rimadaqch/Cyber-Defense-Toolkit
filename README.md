# Cyber Defense Toolkit ## Table of Contents - [Overview](#overview) - [Architecture](#architecture) - [Model](#model) - [Usage](#usage) - [Installation](#installation) - [Contributing](#contributing) - [License](#license) ## Overview The Cyber Defense Toolkit is an advanced AI-driven solution designed to enhance cybersecurity measures by detecting threats, anomalies, and vulnerabilities within network traffic. Leveraging data science and machine learning, this toolkit provides comprehensive insights into network security through automated analysis and visualization. ## Architecture The Cyber Defense Toolkit consists of the following core components: 1. **Threat Detection:** - **Purpose:** Identify potential malicious activities or security breaches within the network traffic. - **Method:** Analyzes key metrics such as packet lengths and flow statistics to detect suspicious activities. 2. **Anomaly Detection:** - **Purpose:** Discover unusual patterns in network traffic that deviate from normal behavior, signifying possible security incidents. - **Method:** Uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify and label anomalies in the data. 3. **Vulnerability Scanning:** - **Purpose:** Detect potential vulnerabilities in network assets that attackers could exploit. - **Method:** Simulates vulnerability scans to identify open ports, outdated software, or misconfigurations. ## Model: Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest ### Overview The Isolation Forest algorithm is employed for anomaly detection, effectively identifying unusual patterns in network traffic. ### Why Isolation Forest? 1. **Efficiency:** - **Linear Time Complexity:** Operates in linear time with low memory requirements. - **Fast Execution:** Quickly isolates anomalies by recursively generating partitions. 2. **Effectiveness:** - **Isolation Principle:** Isolates anomalies by their attribute values, leading to a clear distinction between normal and abnormal data. - **Robust to Noise:** Resilient to noisy data, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. 3. **Versatility:** - **Unsupervised Learning:** Does not require labeled data. - **Handles High Dimensionality:** Effective in high-dimensional spaces without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. ### Implementation The model is trained on the `Flow Bytes/s` feature from the network traffic data. After training, the model predicts anomalies and assigns scores to each data point: ```python import pandas as pd from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest import numpy as np
